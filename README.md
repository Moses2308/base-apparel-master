## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I learned how to plan for layouts that change in a significant way from its mobile layout. I also learned about the outline property and the object fit property.

### Continued development

I would like to get better at breaking down layouts. I would also like to get better at implementing solutions for layouts that have tricky components. I will continue creating projects and reading feedback to gain more experience.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is always a great resource to get more in depth explanations about properties I forgot how to use or to explain new ones.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAAV-uP0po&t=86s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This was a great video by Kevin Powell that finally helped me grasp the idea of how object fit works
